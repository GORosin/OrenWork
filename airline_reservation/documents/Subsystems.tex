\subsection{Client Requests}\label{subsec:clientRequests}

\subsubsection{Class Diagram}
\paragraph{Release 1}

\indent
In release 1, the client had 3 actions that could make through the request classes.
They could make, delete or save reservations.
The requirements only required that the user was able to make and delete a reservation, and that it would persist throughout the system.
In order to make up for the fact that undo was not present in the system, saving the reservations was a separate command to allow for not saving changes that were not wanted.
This was also a pretty poor implementation of the command pattern, as the invoker was never used, and each command was instantiated and removed at use.

\end{center}

\paragraph{Release 2}

\indent
During release 2, the command pattern is moved around and used in a few places.
The requests from Release 1, are still in the client, and provide the undo/redo functionality as they are now meant to by the requirements.
However now they no longer interact with the datahandler directly, they now call routes in the server to perform commands.
Completely invisible to the user, or the client, the actions are then performed on the server.
Now as well as providing a command pattern, this section of the design also provides a proxy pattern for giving the client a place to hit, before all actions are done elsewhere.
A design choice made was to use the command and proxy patterns heavily modified here in order to make it work as we designed.

\end{center}

\paragraph{Release 2}

\indent
In Release 2 we omitted the Invoker entirely as it was unnecessary. We also had to now account for undoing of commands. With this in mind, it was actually pretty easy to implement simple undo/redo functionality as long as we held a request object in memory to allow us to call the undo/execute commands.

\subsection{Itineraries}\label{subsec:itineraries}

\subsubsection{Class Diagram}

\paragraph{Release 1 \& 2}

\indent
The design for Flights and Itineraries is one of the subsystems that is the most easily understood.
Flights and Itineraries share a common interface, and therefore can be used interchangeably by the rest of the system.
This use of the composite pattern is incredibly useful here, and because of that, no changes were made between R1 and R2.

\paragraph{Release 1 \& 2}

In Release 2, we added server route functionality to this subsystem in order to fit it in with the multi-concurrent user system.

\subsection{Sorting Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Class Diagram}

\paragraph{Release 1 \& 2}

\indent
In Release 1, there were a series of classes whose sole purpose was to return a comparator.
During the discussion over the R1 design, it was determined that those extra classes were unnecessary to the use of the strategy pattern.
This was creating a series of classes that served no extra functionality, and simply abstracted a part of the system that never needed to be abstracted.

% Subsystems / Proxy
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Proxy}\label{subsec:proxy}

\indent
In the transition to a client-server subsystem, we implemented a controller for the user to request information.
With the proxy pattern, the system gives the client methods they can call, then translates that call to server.
This way, the client doesnâ€™t need to know where the data is or how to explicitly fetch it.

% Subsystems / RESTFul Web Service
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{RESTFul Web Service}\label{subsec:restfulWebService2}

One significant issue coming from release 1 was the coupling of our queries to the data handler.
With the introduction of a new multi-user requirement, we implemented a Facade Pattern, having our server controller (AFRSController) serve as the facade for all server subsystems to interact in one place.
What keeps it from being anti-pattern is how it is coupled;
none of the subsystems need to know about AFRSController, while direct coupling between queries and datahandler is kept minimal.

\subsection{FAA or Local State}\label{subsec:faaOrLocalState}

\indent
One new requirement in R2 was to allow the user to fetch information from FAA services instead of local. The system initially loads from local anyway, which we believed made it a good fit for the State Pattern. It has an obvious default state (local) and can transition to FAA on request and back. Additionally it only loads local by default, which makes the system load faster than having to load both simultaneously (in case the user never wishes to fetch from FAA). This also makes state transitions after the first one faster since local and FAA remain loaded.
