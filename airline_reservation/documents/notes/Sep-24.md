# Gathered at classroom at 1 pm.
- Oren Rosin, Amanda Ramos, Nicholas Montemorano arrived at classroom. Devin Matte was running late.
- Opened the nouns and verbs documents and began to separate each.
- Nouns highlighted in yellow, green is for verbs.
- We read each sentence one by one and for each sentence we talked about each word we thought was important.
- Within the first few sentences we decided that we would only highlight a word once and not re-highlight if we found it again. 
- We also decided that we would discuss what would and would not be put within the chart as we highlighted.
- One of us reads the requirements and highlights, and one of puts words in the chart.
- We proceeded to write down any nouns we highlighted down in the chart to save time.
- We were going to do the same with verbs but decided that it would take too long for now.

# 1:20pm 
- I started writing all of this down.

# 1:30pm 
- Found an important piece of information but decided it wasn't noun or verb. Instead, underlined sentence.
- Originally thought we wouldn't need to write down subclassed but then decided we needed them.

# 1:40pm 
- Continued discussing nouns and verbs. Still writing them down in chart. No change.

# 1:50pm 
- Finished reading the requirements and highlighting.
- Started to go through the list and sort it out, subclasses, attributes, verbs.
- Crossed out a few words. 
	- Traveler 
	- Exchange
	- Text string
	- Client.
	- And a few others
- With some of the crossed out nouns, we took those and not only discussed what was needed but also if it was part of another noun (as subclass or as attribute).

# 2pm
- I noticed flight was crossed out and discussed why it was crossed out. While it was originally thought not to be of use, we decided it could hold information in it when searching for a flight. 
- Discussed since we had flight information and flight. Discussed whether to keep flight information or flight.
- Will postpone discussion and move on.

# 2:10pm
- Swapped what Flight information and Flight in chart (city, origin airport, destination airport, departure time, arrival time, flight number, airfare, layover time, that originally was in Flight information is now in Flight).
- Wasn't sure about minimum connection time so put a question mark and continued for now.
- Worked with airport. Almost thought we didn't have airport but realized we had Airport name.
- Made noun in chart Airport, contained airport name, airport code, current weather, temperature, airport delay time.

# 2:20pm
- Were discussing Request subclasses and attributes
- Made Passenger a noun in chart. To hold name and reservations.
- Finished nouns!!!
- Taking a break -.-

# 2:30pm
- Back from break!
- Went to work on verbs
- Decided to read through passage and for each verb we highlighted, we would put it within the noun through context.
- Make, store delete within flight.
- Might delete flight information

# 2:40pm
- Still discussing verbs. Most aren't being written down due to client not being part of the system.

# 2:50pm
- Devin Matte arrived.
- Kept working on verbs.
- Made method names from the verbs to make them a little more specific.\

# 3pm
- Nicholas Montemorano had to leave.
- Oren Rosin had to leave.
- Reread and checked
- Done.
