# Gathered at 2:00pm
- All team members are present except for Nick. Nick informed us he could not be in attendance.
- We set forward on getting the actual class diagram built and building out the class structure
- In preparation for actual implementation, the classes were created and structured as to the current spec.
- We still need to implement the actual design patterns as expected
    - We set up RequestCommand in anticipation of creating the command pattern
    - We need further discussion on the other design patterns needed to create the system
